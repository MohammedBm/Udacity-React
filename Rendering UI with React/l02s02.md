# Creating Elements and JSX


To create a react elements we can use the method  `.createElement()`  the createElement method has the following structure

`  React.createElement(/* type */, /* props */ , /*content*/)
`
* By the type we mean the type of the tag like div, a,ul and li

* In props we can insert an object or keep it null. This is an object of HTML attributes and custom data about the element.

*  Content - null, a string , a React Element, or React component. Anything that you pass here will be content of the rendered element. This can include plain text, javascript code, other React elements, etcâ€¦.


With reactElement we can nest elemmts inside of each other for example


```js
Import React from `react`
Import ReactDom from `react-dom`

const people = [
  {name: "Mohammed"},
  {name: "se7o"},
  {name: "Hamza"}
]

// craete a list of name, hard coded
const element = React.createElement('o;', null,
  React.createElement('li',null, "Mohammed"),
  React.createElement('li',null, "se7o"),
  React.createElement('li',null, "Hamza")
)

//creating list of name with dynamic method
const element = React.createElement('ol',null,
  people.map((person, index)=>(
    React.createElement('li',{key: index}, person.name)
    //we need to give a unique name to the props field like name, or the index of the number of the array. It is called also the key props
    // evreytime we use createElement with an array we need a unique element to the key props
  ))
)

ReactDom.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
#### `createElement()` returns one root Element

Recall that `React.createElement( /* type */, /* props */, /* content */ );` creates a single React element of a particular type. We'd normally pass in a tag such as a `<div> `or a `<span>` to represent that type, but the content argument can be another React element!

Consider the following example:
```javascript
const element = React.createElement('div', null,
  React.createElement('strong', null, 'Hello world!')
);
```
Here, "Hello world!" will be wrapped in a `<div>` when this React element renders as HTML. While we can indeed nest React elements, remember the overall call just returns a single element.

We can use JSX to create nested element with easier way instead of using javascript, since jsx is a very similar to HTML but we can write a javascdiprt code inside of them.

```js
Import React from `react`
Import ReactDom from `react-dom`

const people = [
  {name: "Mohammed"},
  {name: "se7o"},
  {name: "Hamza"}
]

const element = <ol>
 //if we need to use javascript here we need to use {} and put javascript inside of them.
  // <li>{people[0].name}</li> //ðŸ‘ˆ one method
  {people.map(person=>(
    <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li> //ðŸ‘ˆ another method
          // ðŸ‘† this will give a unique element to the props
  ))}
</ol>

ReactDom.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Also we will always need to enclose our elements with `<div>` tags or it will throw in error
```js
const message = (
  <div>
    <h1>All About JSX:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>JSX</li>
      <li>is</li>
      <li>awesome!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);
```
ðŸ‘† this is the correct way of creating an element

```js
const message = (
  <h1>All About JSX:</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>JSX</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>awesome!</li>
  </ul>
);
```
ðŸ‘† this is the incorrect way of writing an element and it will throw in error when you run it

#### Intro to Components
So far we've seen how `.createElement()` and JSX can help us produce some HTML. Typically, though, we'll use one of React's key features, Components, to construct our UI. Components refer to reusable pieces of code ultimately responsible for returning HTML to be rendered onto the page. More often than not, you'll see React components written with JSX.

Since React's main focus is to streamline building our app's UI, there is only one method that is absolutely required in any React component class: `render()`.

Let's go ahead and build our first component class!
```js
Import React from `react`
Import ReactDom from `react-dom`

class ContactList extends React.component {
    render(){
      const people = [
        {name: "Mohammed"},
        {name: "se7o"},
        {name: "Hamza"}
      ]

      const element = <ol>
      //if we need to use javascript here we need to use {} and put javascript inside of them.
      // <li>{people[0].name}</li> //ðŸ‘ˆ one method
      {people.map(person=>(
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li> //ðŸ‘ˆ another method
        // ðŸ‘† this will give a unique element to the props
      ))}
      </ol>
    }
}

ReactDom.render(
  <ContactList/>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Components is like creating your own special tag, so you can use it later. In the code above we but our previous code inside a class `class ContactList extends Reaect.component`. and a `render()` method as well. With that class we created our own tag with the name ContactList and we can ask `ReactDom` to render it like that
```js
ReactDom.render(
  <ContactList/>
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
##### Creating Elements Recap
In the end, remember that React is only concerned with the View layer of our app. This is what the user sees and interacts with. As such, we can use `.createElement()` to render HTML onto a document. More often than not, however, you'll use a syntax extension to describe what your UI should look like. This syntax extension is known as JSX, and just looks similar to plain HTML written right into a JavaScript file. The JSX gets compiled down to calls to React's `.createElement()` method that outputs HTML to be rendered in the browser.

A great mindset to have when building React apps is to think in `components`. Components represent the modularity and reusability of React. You can think of your component classes as factories that produce instances of components. These component classes should follow the single responsibility principle and just "do one thing". If it manages too many different tasks, it may be a good idea to decompose your component into smaller subcomponents.
